Welcome to Contracts Management documentation!
===================================


"**Contract management** or **contract administration** is the management of *contracts* made with *customers*, *vendors*, *partners*, or employees. Contract management includes negotiating the terms and conditions in contracts and ensuring compliance with the terms and conditions, as well as documenting and agreeing on any changes or amendments that may arise during its implementation or execution. It can be summarized as the process of systematically and efficiently managing contract creation, execution, and analysis to maximise financial and operational performance and minimise risk." - `Wikipedia <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contract_management>`_
